            <strong >Battlefield 4</strong> is a first-person shooter video game developed by video game developer EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts.
           It is a sequel to 2011's Battlefield 3 and was released in October 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; 
           then later in November for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
           
           <em>Battlefield 4</em>  was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, 
           but was also criticized for its short and shallow single-player campaign mode, and for its numerous bugs and glitches. 
           It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies. </p>

           <strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</strong> is a multiplayer first-person shooter 
           video game developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment.   
           It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series and was released for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, while the Linux version was released in 2014.
           
           The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. 
           Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. 
           The Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages,
           while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb,
           or rescue the hostages. There are nine game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics 
           specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, 
           as well as allowing members of the community to host their own servers with custom maps and game modes. 
           A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in 2018.
            
           Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised for its gameplay and faithfulness to predecessors, 
           though it was criticized for some of its early features and was noted for differences between the console and PC versions. 
           Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month, and has gathered an active competitive scene, 
           with many tournaments sponsored by Valve themselves. 
           In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, 
           focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.
